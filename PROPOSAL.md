CS126 final project: going down as a ball

What project you want to do
You will control a ball on a board, There will be boards on the window and the window is constantly going up, to avoid the ball from vanishing from the upper side of the window 
or falling down and vanish from the bottom side of the window, you have to control the ball to land on another board

What background knowledge do you have on this kind of project, and why do you want to do this project? (Put another way, in what way will you be motivated to see this project to completion?)
This game is related to the previous assignments like ball collisions, so the previous assignments already gave me background knowledge. And this is a classic game
that I used to play as a child, I will be happy to see if I can recollect my childhood memory

A rough timeline of what will get accomplished and when (e.g, "By the end of Week 2, I will have implemented XYZ and will start working on ABC")
By the end of week1, I will create the container, the ball and how the ball collide with the board
By the end of week2, I will set timer to handle stuff, determine whether the ball dies and other losing conditions and add some graphics
By the end of week3, I will create the menu, add more graphics multiple game modes with easy and difficult.

If you were to finish the project early, what extra "stretch goals" could you implement?
I can add some special effects like music and the music when you lose, create different obstacles.
